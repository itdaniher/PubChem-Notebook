basic summaries from pubchem

mirror ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF to this directory

run said script for each `.sdf.gz`

 > for a in SDF/*sdf.gz; do python ./ChEBI_JSON_Builder.py $a; done
 > zcat SDF/*json.gz | gzip - > SDF.json.gz

you now have an 8-9GB text file with charge, mass, name, structure in InChI and SMILES, and CID, one compound per line.
